# Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases
This repository contains code assosciated to the textbook Keeling, M.J. and Rohani, P. (2007) Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals. Princeton University Press. Unless otherwise stated, all code has been taken from their webpage http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masfz/ModelingInfectiousDiseases/index.html . I have made some modifications to the code, mostly to the Python files, to convert them into Jupyter notebooks, update obsolote commands and obtain better graphics.
I used some of the programs here for my (second) student talk "Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases" at the Archimedeans (Cambridge University Mathematical Society). During the talk I run during the simultations 'forestfire' and 'individual', both in the folder for spatial models.
