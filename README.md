# Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases
This repository contains code assosciated to the textbook Keeling, M.J. and Rohani, P. (2007) Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals. Princeton University Press. Unless otherwise stated, all code has been taken from their webpage http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masfz/ModelingInfectiousDiseases/index.html . I have only made minor modifications for formatting purposes.
I used some of the programs here for my (second) student talk "Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases" at the Archimedeans (Cambridge University Mathematical Society), and I will try to point out in some way which are the ones that I run during the talk.
